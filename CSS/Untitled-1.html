	<h1>The Subordinate Clause</h1>
	<h2>Recognize a subordinate clause when you see one.</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p>A subordinate clause—also called a <em>dependent clause</em>—will begin 
		with a <a href="subordinateconjunction.htm">subordinate conjunction</a> 
		or a <a href="relativepronoun.htm">relative pronoun</a> and will contain 
		both a <a href="subject.htm">subject</a> and a <a href="verb.htm">verb</a>. 
		This combination of words will <em>not</em> form a
		<a href="completesentence.htm">complete sentence</a>. It will instead make 
		a reader want additional information to finish the thought.</p>
		<p>Here is a list of subordinate conjunctions:</p>
		<table class="border">
			<tbody><tr>
				<th colspan="3">Subordinate Conjunctions</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>after<br>although<br>as<br>because<br>before<br>even if<br>even 
				though<br>if<br>in order that</td>
				<td>once<br>provided that<br>rather than<br>since<br>so that<br>
				than<br>that<br>though<br>unless</td>
				<td>until<br>when<br>whenever<br>where<br>whereas<br>wherever<br>
				whether<br>while<br>why</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody></table>
		<p>Here are your relative pronouns:</p>
		<table class="border">
			<tbody><tr>
				<th colspan="3">Relative Pronouns</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>that<br>which<br>whichever</td>
				<td>who<br>whoever<br>whom</td>
				<td>whose<br>whosever<br>whomever</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody></table>
		<p>Now take a look at these examples:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="example">After Amy sneezed all over the tuna salad</p>
			<p><span class="special_01">After</span> = subordinate conjunction;
			<span class="special_01">Amy</span> = subject;
			<span class="special_01">sneezed</span> = verb.</p>
			<p class="example">Once Adam smashed the spider</p>
			<p><span class="special_01">Once</span> = subordinate conjunction;
			<span class="special_01">Adam</span> = subject;
			<span class="special_01">smashed</span> = verb.</p>
			<p class="example">Until Mr. Sanchez has his first cup of coffee</p>
			<p><span class="special_01">Until</span> = subordinate conjunction;
			<span class="special_01">Mr. Sanchez</span> = subject;
			<span class="special_01">has</span> = verb.</p>
			<p class="example">Who ate handfuls of Cheerios with his bare hands</p>
			<p><span class="special_01">Who</span> = relative pronoun;
			<span class="special_01">Who</span> = subject;
			<span class="special_01">ate</span> = verb.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><strong>Remember this important point:</strong> A subordinate clause 
		cannot stand alone as a sentence because it does not provide a complete 
		thought. The reader is left wondering, "So what happened?" A word 
		group that begins with a capital letter and ends with a period must contain 
		at least one <a href="mainclause.htm">main clause</a>. Otherwise, you will 
		have written a <a href="fragment.htm">fragment</a>, a major error.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="example">After Amy sneezed all over the tuna salad.</p>
			<p>So what happened? Did Amy throw it down the garbage disposal or serve 
			it on toast to her friends? No complete thought = fragment.</p>
			<p class="example">Once Adam smashed the spider.</p>
			<p>So what happened? Did Belinda cheer him for his bravery or lecture 
			him on animal rights? No complete thought = fragment.</p>
			<p class="example">Until Mr. Sanchez has his first cup of coffee.</p>
			<p>So what happens? Is he too sleepy to work, or does he have a grumpy 
			disposition? No complete thought = fragment.</p>
			<p class="example">Who ate handfuls of Cheerios with his bare hands.</p>
			<p>So what happened? Were the roommates shocked, or did they ask him 
			to pass the box so that they could do the same? No complete thought 
			= fragment.</p>
		</blockquote>
	</blockquote>
	<h2>Correctly attach a subordinate clause to a main clause.</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p>When you attach a subordinate clause <em>in front of</em>&nbsp; a
		<a href="mainclause.htm">main clause</a>, use a comma, like this:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p style="line-height: 200%"><span class="special_02">Subordinate Clause</span> 
			+ <strong>,</strong> + <span class="special_02">Main Clause</span>.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="special_01">Even though the broccoli 
			was covered in cheddar cheese</span>, Emily refused to eat it.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="special_01">Unless Christine finishes 
			her calculus homework</span>, she will have to suffer Mr. Nguyen's 
			wrath in class tomorrow.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="special_01">While Bailey slept on the 
			sofa in front of the television</span>, Samson, the family dog, gnawed 
			on the leg of the coffee table.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>When you attach a subordinate clause <em>at the end of</em> a main clause, 
		you will generally use <em>no punctuation</em>, like this:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p style="line-height: 200%"><span class="special_02">Main Clause</span> 
			+ Ø + <span class="special_02">Subordinate Clause</span>.</p>
			<p class="example">Tanya did poorly on her history exam Ø
			<span class="special_01">because her best friend Giselle insisted on 
			gossiping during their study session the night before</span>.</p>
			<p class="example">Jonathon spent his class time reading comic books Ø
			<span class="special_01">since his average was a 45 one week before 
			final exams</span>.</p>
			<p class="example">Diane decided to plant tomatoes in the back of the 
			yard Ø <span class="special_01">where the sun blazed the longest 
			during the day</span>.</p>
		</blockquote>
	</blockquote>
	<h2>Punctuate carefully when the subordinate clause begins with a relative pronoun.</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Subordinate clauses can begin with relative pronouns [and thus are called
		<a href="relativeclause.htm">relative clauses</a>, a type of subordinate 
		clause]. When a subordinate clause starts with <span class="special_01">
		who</span>, <span class="special_01">whose</span>, or
		<span class="special_01">which</span>, for example, punctuation gets a little 
		bit trickier. Sometimes you will need a comma, and sometimes you won't, 
		depending on whether the clause is essential or nonessential.</p>
		<p>When the information in the relative clause clarifies an otherwise general 
		noun, the clause is <a href="essentialclause.htm">essential</a> and will 
		follow the same pattern that you saw above:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p style="line-height: 200%"><span class="special_02">Main Clause</span> 
			+ Ø + <span class="special_02">Essential Relative Clause</span>.</p>
			<p class="example">Nick gave a handful of potato chips to the dog Ø
			<span class="special_01">who was sniffing around the picnic tables</span>.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><span class="special_01">Dog</span> is a general noun. Which one are 
		we talking about? The relative clause <span class="special_01">who was sniffing 
		around the picnic tables</span> clarifies the animal that we mean. The clause 
		is thus essential and requires no punctuation.</p>
		<p>When a relative clause follows a specific noun, punctuation changes. 
		The information in the relative clause is no longer as important, and the 
		clause becomes nonessential. <a href="nonessentialclause.htm">Nonessential 
		clauses</a> require you to use commas to connect them.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p style="line-height: 200%"><span class="special_02">Main Clause</span> 
			+ <strong>,</strong> + <span class="special_02">Nonessential Relative 
			Clause</span>.</p>
			<p class="example">Nick gave a handful of potato chips to Button
			<span class="special_01">, who was sniffing around the picnic tables</span>.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><span class="special_01">Button</span>, the name of a <em>unique dog</em>, 
		lets us know which animal we mean. The information in the relative clause 
		is no longer important and needs to be separated from the main clause with 
		a comma.</p>
		<p>Relative clauses can also <em>interrupt</em> a main clause. When this 
		happens, use no punctuation for an essential clause. If the clause is nonessential, 
		separate it with a comma in front <em>and</em> a comma behind. Take a look 
		at these examples:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="example">After dripping mustard all over his chest, the man Ø
			<span class="special_01">who was wearing a red shirt</span> Ø 
			wished that he had instead chosen ketchup for his hotdog.</p>
			<p class="example">After dripping mustard all over his chest, Charles,
			<span class="special_01">who was wearing a red shirt</span>, wished 
			that he had instead chosen ketchup for his hotdog.</p>
		</blockquote>
	</blockquote>
	<h2>Use subordination to combine ideas effectively.</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Writers use subordination to combine two ideas in a single sentence. 
		Read these two simple sentences:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="example">Rhonda gasped. A six-foot snake slithered across 
			the sidewalk.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Since the two simple sentences are related, you can combine them to express 
		the action more effectively:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="example">Rhonda gasped <span class="special_01">when</span> 
			a six-foot snake slithered across the sidewalk.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>If the two ideas have unequal importance, save the most important one 
		for the end of the sentence so that your reader remembers it best. If we 
		rewrite the example above so that the two ideas are flipped, the wrong point 
		gets emphasized:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="example">When a six-foot snake slithered across the side walk, 
			Rhonda gasped.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>A reader is less concerned with Rhonda's reaction than the presence 
		of a giant snake on the sidewalk!</p>
